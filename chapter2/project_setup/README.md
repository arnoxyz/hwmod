# Project Setup - Quartus
Introduction to the Quartus workflow. So now the VHDL code gets not only simulated with tools like Modelsim/GHDL but real synthesized (generates real hw) this is done with the tool: Quartus.

## Start Quartus
The option --64bit is used so that quartus runs in the 64bit version. The & at the end is used so that quartus runs starts in the background. (usefull when working with the terminal because the terminal can then later still be used for other stuff.)
```
quartus --64bit &
```
