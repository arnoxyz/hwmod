**Points:** 1 ` | ` **Keywords:** vhdldraw, control flow

In this your imagination is the only limit. Draw anything you fancy using VHDLDraw in [creative.vhd](src/creative.vhd).

You can program whatever **you** want to as long as you adhere to a few requirements:

- Your code must contain at least one process.
- You have to use at least one `for` loop
- Your program must contain at least one `while` loop
- Use at least two distinct conditional statements (e.g., `if`, `case`). The branches of an `if` do not count as multiple conditional statements.
- You must implement and use at least one subprogram.

You get the point for this task if your submission adheres to the above requirements and it is obvious that this is an honest attempt of you engaging with VHDL.
